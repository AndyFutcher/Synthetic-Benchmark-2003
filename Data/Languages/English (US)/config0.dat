tltpa121=This benchmark aims to test the generally slower components related to data processing. Your Random Access Memory and Chipset have a large effect on these scores.
tltpa122=This benchmark tests the speed of your FPU's ability to process very complicated mathematical calculations. Your CPUs internal Floating point unit has a pivotal role in this test.
tltpa123=This benchmark tests the speed of your computers ability to manipulate simple numbers (integers). Integers are used heavily in internal software code for loops && common data processing.
tltpa124=This test determines your operating systems control over the other programs running within Windows. The number && type of programs running on your system will effect this benchmark.
tltpa125=This benchmark reveals how well your CPU and your RAM work together. The score is the number of operations your processor can perform in one complete memory allocation cycle.
tltpa126=This test determines your systems ability to handle processing power if every TSR(service) running requested the maximum processor usage. Great theoretical multi-tasking benchmark.
tltpa127=This benchmark tests your selected hard drives ability to read && write large files. Your hard drives RPM (revolutions per minute) greatly effect the resulting scores.
tltpa128=This test focuses on preventing your OS and HDD cache memory from optimizing the data access. The scores returned with this benchmark indicate a more accurate true disk performance.
tltpa129=This benchmark tests your OS and hard drives ability to manage your data File Allocation Table. Your FAT performance is greatly improved by Defragging regularly.
tltpa130=This test focuses on your OS and hard drives ability to reduce data redundancy(repetition) in your disks access. This is the exact opposite to the Raw Disk benchmark.
tltpa131=This benchmark tests your CD/DVD drives ability to read liner data at high speed .Scores are improved by having a faster rated drive (eg. x52), and some CD-burners will do very well too!
tltpa132=This benchmark is very similar to the HDD FAT benchmark, modified for CD/DVD drives .Scores indicate the laser head movement speed and media quality.
tltpa133=This very innovative benchmark tests your sound card (and drivers) ability to output as many direct sound buffer injections per second. Scores are improved by having more audio channels and newer drivers.
tltpa134=This benchmark tests your graphic drivers 2D performance when running under the Windows graphical user interface. These scores indicate Windows ability to manipulate graphics.
tltpa135=This benchmark tests your CPUs && graphics card ability to render video movies at high speeds. Scores are quite relative to your computers movie rendering ability on your PC.
tltpa136=This benchmark is very dependant on your countries backbone, ISPs priority settings and connection quality to achieve web surfing scores rated in pages per minute. We suggest competing with local competition as the Host chooses the URL list.
tltpa137=This benchmark tests your network or internet bi-directional ping, this is not a normal ping, but rather a two-way miniature hand shake. Reflects the maximum number of two way packets send per second
tltpa138=This benchmark tests your network or internet ability to transfer large data packets. The higher scores the better your connection is at downloading/uploading/game hosting.
tltpa139=This interesting benchmark tests your connection speed in averaged sized random raw data transfers, and then the same data packets under a compression protocol. PC speed does not effect scores.
tltpa140=These interactive benchmarks require your involvement. This particular one requires you to constantly move your mouse to measure your pointer update performance.
tltpa141=This interactive test requires you to click you mouse as fast as you can; this is more of a fun benchmark.
tltpa142=This interactive benchmark requires you to hold down any of the keys on your keyboard to measure your cursor and keyboard update performance.
tltpa143=These interactive tests require you to tap one of the keys on your keyboard as fast as you can, careful not to press too hard or you may damage your keyboard. It is quite fun to see who can tap faster.

prgtip0=Welcome to SynthMark XP Benchmarking Suite!</b></b>Remember that SynthMark XP is quite different to other benchmarking systems because of its Synthetic nature.</b></b>Rather than trying to indicate how fast your hardware is, SynthMark XP gives you a true indication on what performance your applications actually receive after your operating system and TSR�s (background services) have taken their required attention from your hardware.
prgtip1=Why use SynthMark XP over other benchmarking suites?</b></b>SynthMark XP gives you scores relating to the true performance of your computer, not from your hardware�s point of view, but rather from a software perspective.</b></b>The two main types of benchmarking, namely Synthetic mode which is basically software emulation, and Real-time mode with is much more hardware orientated.
prgtip2=For those of you who did not know?</b></b>It's an enduring fact that applications only receive a small portion of your hardware�s full processing potential. Even though faster hardware does make a huge difference to application performance, often the determining factor is the operating system, driver subsystems and TSR service using additional processor time, slowing down your applications and games.</b></b>This is how a 600MHz PC can be beaten in SynthMark by a 450MHz PC which is better optimized!
prgtip3=You will notice that SynthMark XP features a new Graphical User Interface. This interface is multi-lingual and themeable with downloadable skins. The major differences are described here...</b></b>1. The ALT key is now used to jump to any control which has a letter that is underlined, example here [Use the ALT+j key to &jump here]!</b>2. Certain options in the drop down menus can stay open after they have been clicked, like a toggle button.</b>3. Space Bar or the Enter key serve as a mouse key while using the keyboard with SynthMark XP.
prgtip4=Note for language switching...</b></b>When switching the language or theme for SynthMark XP, some textual or graphics elements may not change immediately, in general, we suggest you restart SynthMark XP after you change any of these settings.</b></b>New languages or themes can be downloaded from our downloads section on our site or installed via your setup bundle.
prgtip5=Consider upgrading to the full version!</b></b>Some of the features built-into SynthMark XP make be temporarily disabled until you register your copy of SynthMark XP with Andy Futcher.</b></b>These features include the hardware benchmarking mode(real-time), advanced system optimization through the ATM, password systems and the project export tools and more benefits from Andy Futcher.
prgtip6=The different benchmarking modes...</b></b>Synthetic mode balances SynthMark�s demand for your processor with any applications running on your operating system, including its own services, giving you scores which are software related (multi-tasked)!</b></b>Real-time mode is the opposite and actually crashes your operating system for the milliseconds at a time to get the best hardware related scores.
prgtip7=You will notice that SynthMark XP displays a progress bar while the benchmarks are being processed. This can be done without interfering with the scores because SynthMark XP does five miniature benchmarks instead of one big one...</b></b>This has quite a few additional advantages, you will notice there is a stability result for each benchmark. This is the differences between the five benchmarks, the higher the percentage, the more consistent your benchmark results were!
prgtip8=One of the best features SynthMark XP includes is the ability to compete across a network or over the internet using our NETMark system.</b></b>NETMark allows you to connect to a chat room and compare benchmarks online with other people, but it also allows you to run benchmarks without the clients interfering with your scores keeping it fair && competitive for all the SynthMark XP users, weather you are the host or just a client platform.
prgtip9=You may want to take advantage of our excellent help && support system called Ask the Xpert.</b></b>This system originally got its name from our instant access support email system, which sends us additional hardware information of your computer so we can answer your questions to the best of our ability.</b></b>This system also includes a comprehensive built-in support for all Andy Futcher products...
prgtip10=When creating a NETMark server...</b></b>You can use our new chat-catch-up system, which will automatically send your new users a complete run down of all the chat information before they entered.</b></b>You can also choose to not list this server publicly, meaning that SynthMark XP wont advertise you server on the search for servers window to other users.
prgtip11=If you want to run a private server, you can setup a password for your new NETMark server so only users you know will be able to join.</b></b>You can also password protect your SynthMark XP saved projects, preventing other SynthMark users from editing your projects.</b></b>(Both these features require the full version).
prgtip12=Before you start benchmarking, we suggest you setup your user profile and comments first before continuing with your SynthMark experience.</b></b>User comments are optional, but we suggest saying your favourite motto or an additional description of your computer.
prgtip13=To make your SynthMark XP experience even better, we added dynamic explorer panels down the left of your SynthMark XP window.</b></b>These can be maximized or minimized individually and will always show you the common tasks you can perform with SynthMark XP.</b></b>Also place a tick in the 'Quick Help' box in the top right of this window to get instant tool tips for quick learning with SynthMark XP... Yeah, we know none of you are going to use our help system :-P
prgtip14=Community servers VS. Public servers</b></b>Generally only a 24 hour server would be considered for a community server, whereas a public server is dependant on the host.</b>Community servers have to be registered with us but also allow the webmasters to advertise their websites and attract people or enthusiast groups to their servers.</b></b>If you would like to host a community server, click the NETMark drop down menu, followed by the 'register community' option. 
prgtip15=Using the burn-in wizard...</b></b>You can use this wizard anytime you are not online with SynthMark XP.</b>The burn-in wizard allows you to test your computers reliability under a constant stressful processing situation.</b></b>You can run the burn-in wizard for your hard drives but use caution with this tool at all times!
prgtip16=Understanding content storage settings...</b></b>The content storage manager found under the tools menu will allow you to setup SynthMark XP limits for the chat window (number of lines), but also for the score and graph windows.</b></b>Adjusting these settings higher will result in SynthMark XP using more memory from your computer, so computers with low memory should use restraint with these settings.
prgtip17=Loading and saving presets with SynthMark XP.</b></b>To run specific benchmarks, make sure you have a session open, either a single session or a NETMark session will do. Then select the benchmarks drop down menu and you will see all the benchmark types listed in categories.</b></b>If you are happy with the current benchmark selection you can then save that preset with the 'load/save preset' menu. If you want to revert to that preset at a later stage use the same menu and click the load preset option.
